            <p><strong>Situation : </strong>COVID-19 has been on a rampage all across the globe since the past 5 months. From less than a million cases in February, and currently having more than 10 million cases across the globe. 

              The good news is that doctors across the globe have been able to recover more than 5 million COVID patients, with a loss of less than half a million souls. These patients can help improve the recovery rate by donating their plasma.
              
              With a vaccine still a long way away, plasma therapy has been developed as an experimental cure for COVID. Plasma therapy has been helping a lot of families recover their loved ones from COVID.
              <br><br>
              <strong>But since there are very few plasma donors currently, a lot of people who can be saved using this therapy are not getting the required treatment.</strong>
              </p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">For the last few weeks, we have witnessed a flood of heart-wrenching posts on social media platforms from people looking for life-saving plasma for their loved ones. <strong>Hospitals simply do not have enough.</strong> 
              <br><br>
              <strong>Mission : </strong> Our aim is to match COVID recovered individuals with patients who are in need of plasma therapy. The Plasma Bank is a small step towards solving the problem of finding eligible donors in a situation where time is of great essence. 
              
              We sincerely hope you or your loved ones never have to go through this ordeal. But if you do, then we aspire to be able to help you by connecting you with volunteer donors. </p>

                    &emsp;&emsp;Blood is drawn from the donor, plasma is separated from blood by special procedures and is administered in the blood of the recipient.The process for donating plasma is similar to donating blood and takes about an hour. Plasma donors are hooked up to a small device that removes plasma while simultaneously returning red blood cells to their bodies. Unlike regular blood donation in which donors have to wait for red blood cells to replenish between donations,plasma can be donated more frequently, as often as twice a week.

                    &emsp;&emsp;An antibody test is a screening for antibodies in blood. It is also called a serology test.The antibody test isn’t checking for the virus itself. Instead, it looks to see whether your immune system -- your body’s defense against illness -- has responded to the infection.

                    &emsp;&emsp;A coronavirus test, sometimes called a diagnostic test, looks for signs of active virus. It’s simpler and faster than an antibody test. But it tells you only if you have the virus in your body at the moment when you’re tested.An antibody test shows that you had the virus at some point in the past. It could be gone, or you could still be contagious.
